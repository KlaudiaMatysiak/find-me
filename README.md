# Find Me! Game
![Responsive Design](documentation/images/mockup.png)
Find Me! Game is memory type of game, I would say it's [Dark Souls](https://www.quora.com/What-makes-the-Dark-Souls-series-so-hard) of the memory games. What makes The Find Me game so hard? There is no place for a mistake and it's time limited. The player has only 5 seconds to remember the board and then have 5 seconds to find a match. There is no winning or loosing per se, but you're earning points for every match and you keep the score on the score list, so you can beat your own score or play local with a friends. The main purpose of the game is to train you memory muscle, and to have fun of course!

## Design
![Palette](documentation/images/palette.png)

[Direct link to the palette](https://coolors.co/6199af-ffffff-585858-b5dae9)

I've choosen Air Superiority Blue and White colors for main layout colors. Text is either white or Davys Grey depends of the background color. Lighy Blue color is only use for styling score board list.

## Wireframes
I created wireframes in the balsamiq program as first visual concept of the website.
My vision was to have very similar version of the layout game for mobile and desktop view.
Full PDF file with wireframes you can find [here](documentation/files/wireframes.pdf)

Mobile view

# Features
## Home Page
Desktop View is very similar to mobile view. Main reason for designing menu in the middle of the screen is to focus user attention on it. It's very simple display, which is why user find it very handy while navigate through it.

### Player's nickname input
Nickname input has been created to provide player's nickname, then it's saved in Local Storage to read data in order to create Score List. Nickname needs to be inserted to start the game and can not be longer then 12 characters. Once user set their nickname, there is no need to put it again because the input value is set from Local Storage.
